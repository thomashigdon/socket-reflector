I've included example invocations and output for the cases you asked for.
I've also included a script, compile.sh, that is the compile command line
I used.

I've included my /proc/cpuinfo in case it's useful.

This could probably be made faster by using non-blocking sockets and some other
things, but I've spent enough time on this already.
